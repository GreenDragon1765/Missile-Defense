# Weapons Header File (weapons.h)
This is the header file containing the class information for the Turret and later for the Missile. Each instance of a turret will be pulled from this header file.
This class uses encapsulation to stop the user from changing turret information to make sure it is consistent. It contains a lot of information about the turret to
make sure that they can run properly.
