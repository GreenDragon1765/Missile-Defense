# Main Program Pseudocode
This will be the main program overview, including pseudocode and discussion topics regarding the functionality of this file. This file will initialize the system itself by launching a command line interface for the user to interact with. Firstly, a help option will be available. This menu the user interacts with will strongly resemble a shell script. The main program will be compiled in C++ using the G++ compiler through the utilization of a Makefile. Any and all subsequent files that will be included in this project will be files that the main program is dependent on, and will need to be compiled alongside the main program, which is the primary purpose of the Makefile.

The menu will be a command line iterface, and will need to include functionality to make sure that the visual representation of the system is clean and concise, so clear screen methods will be necessary as well. To prevent clutter within the main program, it may be deemed necessary to include yet another file to store many of the utility functions that the main program'm menu will draw from.

Main function arguments, for now, this will remain blank, though it may be included as development progresses and a need for it is warranted. The tasks associated with the development of this menu will be the first on the list, development will follow a top down approach for now.
